You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /home/littlecrabby/projects/cognistore

✔ Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select 
features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Firestore: Configure security rules and indexes 
files for Firestore, Genkit: Setup a new Genkit project with Firebase, Functions: Configure a 
Cloud Functions directory and its files, Hosting: Set up deployments for static web apps, 
Storage: Configure a security rules file for Cloud Storage, Authentication: Set up Firebase 
Authentication, AI Logic: Set up Firebase AI Logic with app provisioning

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 

i  Using project cognistore-725e9 (Cognistore) .

=== Firestore Setup
i  firestore: ensuring required API firestore.googleapis.com is enabled...

Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

✔ What file should be used for Firestore Rules? firestore.rules
i  Downloaded the existing Firestore Security Rules from the Firebase console

Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

✔ What file should be used for Firestore indexes? firestore.indexes.json
i  Downloaded the existing Firestore indexes from the Firebase console
✔  Wrote firestore.rules
✔  Wrote firestore.indexes.json

=== Genkit Setup
✔ Genkit's Firebase integration uses Cloud Functions for Firebase with TypeScript.
Initialize Functions to continue? Yes
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

✔ Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
✔  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.js
✔  Wrote functions/tsconfig.dev.json
✔  Wrote functions/package.json
✔  Wrote functions/tsconfig.json
✔  Wrote functions/src/index.ts
✔  Wrote functions/.gitignore
✔ Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes
